### What is this?
Due to COVID-19 it seems the 2020 FRC season will remain nutorious as the postponed season.
But why can't we use the time to learn something new and grow some? So I decided to compile this list of recommended reading in an array of topics relevant for FRC!
Naturally, as a software guy I have more resources for software, so any additions are welcome!
